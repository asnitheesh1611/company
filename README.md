This project was made with the to familarise use of the concept 'angular routing'.Angular routing is used to enable the navigation between applications.

First we created an app named 'Company',installed bootstrap and created four components named 'Home,About,Contact and Service'.We desdigned the corresponding pages of components accordingly.
Then we imported HttpClientModule,RouterModule and Routes in app.module.ts inorder to implement angular routing.
Then we created a nav bar containing four links and called corresponding components through these links using the tag routerlink.
